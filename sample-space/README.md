Introduction to D3 workshop for NYCDA alumni in the Winter of 2018. 

Let's learn D3 development, two basic notions from statistics, and naive set theory by visualizing the sample space for rolling two dice.

To include:

* function to return random outputs that represent the rolls of two dice
* visualiztion of a two-dimensional sample space
* mapping of dice roll results to points in the sample space
* alternatively represent the points of the sample space as a table of numbers
